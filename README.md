# Project Lists

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|---|
| [FULL EXCEL PROJECT : Customer Shopping Data](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/FULL-EXCEL-PROJECT-Customer-Shopping-Data) | Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation | For this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in Microsoft Excel by cleaning and aggregating a dataset of 90,000 rows. | - |
| [TABLEAU AND SQL PROJECT : Bike-Share Dashboard](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/TABLEAU-AND-SQL-PROJECT-Bike-Share-Dashboard) | Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization | Completed a case study project for Google Data Analytics Certification, analyzing ride data. Conducted tasks such as identifying peak months, determining the most preferred rideable type, and exploring ride lengths by weekday and rideable type. Utilized Microsoft SQL Server for data cleaning and aggregation on a 5 million-row dataset, and transferred it to Tableau for visualization. Created dashboards to present insights, including peak months, preferred rideable types, and common ride durations. | - |  
| [POWER BI AND SQL PROJECT : Internet Sales Report](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/POWER-BI-AND-SQL-PROJECT-Internet-Sales-Report) | Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization | Conducted sales analysis to identify best-selling products, customer preferences, and assess sales performance against the budget. Cleaned and aggregated data using Microsoft SQL Server on a dataset of over 50,000 rows. Created Power BI data models, dashboards, and extracted key insights without including specific results. | - |  
| [Data Retrieval by SQL: Pizza Sales](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/Data-Retrieval-SQL-Pizza-Sales) | Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Retrieval | This project involves extracting valuable insights from a fictitious pizza place's sales data using SQL queries. Key analyses include retrieving the total number of orders, calculating daily total sales, identifying the top 5 most popular pizza types based on quantity ordered, determining total revenue for each pizza category, calculating average pizza prices by size, pinpointing the top 3 busiest hours of the day, and investigating the impact of dynamic pricing on average pizza prices during weekdays versus weekends. These analyses collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of sales trends, customer preferences, and potential strategies for optimizing revenue and operational efficiency in a pizza restaurant setting. | - |
| [Retail Supermarket Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/Retail-Supermarket-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA/blob/main/Retail%20Supermarket%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(EDA).ipynb) | Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis | This data analysis project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from a supermarket sales dataset through data visualization. The objectives include understanding sales trends over time, optimizing logistics by identifying prevalent ship modes, recognizing regional patterns, prioritizing product categories based on sales contributions, studying the correlation between discounts and profits for pricing strategies, evaluating city or state-wise sales performance, managing inventory through quantity sold variations across categories, and exploring discount distribution among customer segments. Additionally, the analysis aims to improve delivery efficiency by assessing profit across shipping modes and uncovering the correlation between quantity sold and profit. The ultimate goal is to provide strategic decision-makers with actionable insights for informed decision-making, fostering improvements in overall supermarket chain performance. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
| [Regression Analysis for Price of OLX Cars](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/Regression-Analysis-for-Price-of-OLX-Cars/blob/main/Regression%20Analysis%20for%20Price%20of%20OLX%20Cars.ipynb) | Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Regression Analysis | This project revolves around the exploration and utilization of a comprehensive dataset derived from OLX Cars Listings, capturing authentic details without any fabricated entries. The primary objective is to develop a robust regression model aimed at predicting the resale prices of used OLX Cars accurately. This model serves as a valuable tool for both sellers and buyers, facilitating well-informed pricing decisions within the OLX Cars marketplace. The regression model incorporates relevant features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and other significant factors to ensure precise price predictions. By employing linear regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models, the project aims to enhance pricing transparency and efficiency, ultimately empowering users to make informed decisions in the realm of used car transactions. The conclusive findings reveal that the XGBoost Algorithm outperforms others with an R2 score of 0.838200, MAE of 355238.121100, and MSE of 221837828833.064911, making it the preferred model for accurate resale price predictions in the OLX Cars marketplace. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, category_encoders |
