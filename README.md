| [Regression Analysis for Price of OLX Cars](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/Regression-Analysis-for-Price-of-OLX-Cars/blob/main/Regression%20Analysis%20for%20Price%20of%20OLX%20Cars.ipynb) | Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Regression Analysis | This project revolves around the exploration and utilization of a comprehensive dataset derived from OLX Cars Listings, capturing authentic details without any fabricated entries. The primary objective is to develop a robust regression model aimed at predicting the resale prices of used OLX Cars accurately. This model serves as a valuable tool for both sellers and buyers, facilitating well-informed pricing decisions within the OLX Cars marketplace. The regression model incorporates relevant features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and other significant factors to ensure precise price predictions. By employing linear regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models, the project aims to enhance pricing transparency and efficiency, ultimately empowering users to make informed decisions in the realm of used car transactions. The conclusive findings reveal that the XGBoost Algorithm outperforms others with an R2 score of 0.838200, MAE of 355238.121100, and MSE of 221837828833.064911, making it the preferred model for accurate resale price predictions in the OLX Cars marketplace. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, category_encoders |
| [Classification Analysis for Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/amirulafiqrosli/Classification-Analysis-for-Diabetes-Prediction/blob/main/Classification%20Analysis%20for%20Diabetes%20Prediction.ipynb) | Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Classification Analysis | In this diabetes classification analysis, our objective is to construct a robust and interpretable machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on a comprehensive set of medical and demographic features. The predictive model is trained and optimized using diverse algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, k-NN, and SVM. Leveraging features such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level, the analysis aims to furnish healthcare professionals with a reliable tool to identify individuals at risk of diabetes. Emphasis is placed on assessing model generalization on validation data, identifying key predictive features, ensuring interpretability, and addressing potential imbalances in positive and negative diabetes cases. The overarching goal is to provide actionable insights that contribute to personalized treatment plans and enhance understanding of the intricate relationships between various factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, category_encoders, imbalanced-learn |
